Matlab codes illustrating some parts of the paper "Temporal dispersion correction for wave-propagation modelling with a series approach".

Matrices in the appendix are generated by
```abmatrix.m``` and in symbolic form by ```abmatrixsym.m```. The latter requires the Symbolic Matlab Toolbox.

The example in the background section can be reproduced by ```addremove_ft.m```. Its counterpart with series in the time domain is ```addremove_series.m```.
